# Selection Sort

Selection sorts through a collection of items by mantaining a sublist of the collection that is initially given as the sorted sublist. It iterates through the collection and one by one, inserts elements into their correct spots in the sorted sublist.

In its best case scenario it runs at O(n), and it occurs when the collection is already sorted. Its worst case scenario is O(nÂ²), and it occurs when the list is reverse sorted. So this algorithms is usually at its best when the colletion is small and is mostly sorted.
