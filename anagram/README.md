# Anagram

Check to see if two provided strings are anagrams of eachother. One string is anagram of another if it uses the same characters in the same quantity. Only consider characters, not spaces or punctuation. Consider capital letters to be the same as lower case letters.

Examples:

    anagrams('rail safety', 'fairy tales') --> true
    anagrams('RAIL! Safety!', 'fairy tales') --> true
    anagrams('Hi there', 'Bye there') --> false
