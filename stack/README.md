# Stack

A stack is data set of contiguous memory structured as  Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) - this structure limits data in the way that it can only be added to or removed from the top.

The common idea used to understand this structure is a stack of plates. You're only able to add or remove plates in a stack from the top, no other way is allowed if you don't want to make a mess.

## Common Operations

* pop - Deletes and returns the data at the top of the stack.
* push - Inserts data at the top of the stack.
* peek - Returns the data at the top of the stack but DOES NOT delete it.
* isEmpty - Returns a boolean indicating if the stack is empty or not.

## Common Applications

* Backtracking features - The back button in a browser or the back option in some applications. Linked lists are also used for this purpose.
* Function calls in a computer - The sequence of function calls in a computer follows a LIFO structure.
